# RushMeDesign
It doesn't matter how good it is if nobody wants to use it. 

Contains documentation on UI/UX work consisting of both a working and finalized style guide, high fidelity screen mock-ups, and other notes/documents that help contextualize design decisions.

#### *[Working Style Guide](https://github.com/RushMeTeam/RushMeDesign/blob/master/style%20guides/RM_StyleGuideF18.pdf "Working Style Guide")*
A comprehensive guide on where RushMe has been and how it arrived to where it is. Updated when anything as small as fonts, palettes, or a position of a menu changes. Has all past iterations and considerations of the team.


#### *Finalized Style Guide*
###### *(TO BE ADDED)*
The official document that should be followed when creating new designs. Contains usage details, fonts, padding, colors, etc. that serve as the current design paradigm for the application.


#### *High Fidelity Mocks*
###### *(TO BE ADDED)*
Detailed prototypes and mockup screens of two types: a realistic approach and an ideal. 


#### *Other*
###### (TBD)
Some other stuff ¯\\__(ツ)__/¯ (probably notes etc)
