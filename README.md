# RushMeDesign
RushMeDesign develops and documents the platform's User Interface and Experience (UI & UX), namely the platform's working and finalized style guides, high fidelity screen mock-ups, and the context of design decisions.

#### *[Working Style Guide](https://github.com/RushMeTeam/RushMeDesign/blob/master/style%20guides/RM_StyleGuideF18.pdf "Working Style Guide")*
A guide to RushMeDesign's past and present (read: drafts and frequent updates). Updates for changes as slight as font, color, or layout. The repository is a living history of the team's design ideology.


#### *Finalized Style Guide*
###### *(Future)*
The official document that should be followed when creating new designs. Contains usage details, fonts, padding, colors, etc. that serve as the current design paradigm for the application.


#### *High Fidelity Mocks*
###### *(Future)*
Detailed prototypes and mockup screens, including both practical and ideal. 


#### *Other*
Some other stuff ¯\\__(ツ)__/¯ (probably notes etc)
